title: "LegalEval Large Language Model: Understanding Legal Texts"
excerpt: "Developed a custom PyTorch data loader that enhanced LLaMA2 model accuracy by 15% for log probability analysis, showcasing expertise in optimizing deep learning workflows. Leveraged Hugging Face Accelerate and DeepSpeed ZeRO 3 to implement model parallelism, reducing training time by 30% on A100 GPUs. Applied these advancements to legal text classification tasks for SemEval 2023 LegalEval, including Rhetorical Roles Labeling and Court Judgment Prediction, delivering impactful results in natural language processing.

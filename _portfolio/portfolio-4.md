title: "Matrix Theory Linear Algebra Algorithms"
excerpt: "In Matrix Analysis for Scientists and Engineers by Alan J. Laub, algorithms are designed to provide efficient computational techniques for linear algebra operations, such as matrix decompositions, solving linear systems, and eigenvalue computations. Building on these concepts, I developed Python implementations of key linear algebra algorithms and matrix formulas foundational to machine learning models. These include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), linear and logistic regression, least squares optimization, and k-means clustering, enabling efficient data processing and insights into high-dimensional datasets.

title: "Wikiscraper"
excerpt: "
Developed a novel program in C++ to find link ladders between two Wikipedia pages using an intelligent algorithm to identify optimal paths. This project involved leveraging core C++ features such as iterators, algorithms, and containers to efficiently traverse and analyze graph-like structures. The program not only enhanced problem-solving and algorithmic design skills but also deepened expertise in fundamental C++ concepts.

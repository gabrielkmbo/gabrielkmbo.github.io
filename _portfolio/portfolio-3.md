title: "Convolutional Neural Network Bird Classifier"
excerpt: "Led the development of a custom bird classification model in PyTorch, achieving 87% accuracy on a dataset of 3,113 bird images. Utilized data augmentation and GAN-based image generation techniques to reduce overfitting by 20%, enhancing model generalization. This project demonstrated proficiency in deep learning and image classification, addressing challenges in dataset variability.
